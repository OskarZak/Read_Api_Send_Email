Read_Api_Send_email
The project downloads data from the API on bike parks in individual countries, then the email addresses of users are assigned to the countries. The API data is converted into a table using the pandas library. Then, a table with the location of bike parks in the country assigned to the corresponding email address is sent to the email addresses.

In order for the program to work perfect, the user should:

install all files contained in requirements.txt
set the environment variable
in the code change the data for email addresses, pickups and senders
change the mail server (Outlook default)
